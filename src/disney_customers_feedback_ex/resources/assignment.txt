Stampli ML Engineer Home assignment

Background
Disney wants to leverage AI to enable customer experience teams to query customer reviews in natural language. Your role is to design and implement a minimal, production-oriented prototype that demonstrates how this could work in practice. You are provided with a dataset of customer reviews about their parks (disney-reviews.zip).
Task
1. System Design & Architecture
- Propose an end-to-end architecture for the solution.
- Cover data flow, model serving (LLM or RAG), and performance considerations.
- Include monitoring components (logging, metrics, alerts).
- Deliverable: a diagram + short explanation of tradeoffs.

2. Prototype Implementation
- Build a minimal service (FastAPI/Flask) that answers natural language questions about the dataset (Use both review text and metadata).
- Leverage the provided 4o-mini LLM.
- Add simple logging (e.g., request counts, latency).

3. Monitoring & Validation
- Define key metrics to track (system latency, throughput, error rate; model drift/quality).
- Implement at least one automated test.
- Propose how you would evaluate quality and handle scale.

Example Questions
Your system should be able to handle queries like:
- What do visitors from Australia say about Disneyland in Hong Kong?
- Is spring a good time to visit Disneyland?
- Is Disneyland California usually crowded in June?
- Is the staff in Paris friendly?

Deliverables
- Code for the prototype (API + minimal tests).
- Architecture diagram + explanation.
- Short writeup or slides describing architecture, performance, and monitoring.

Evaluation Criteria
We will assess candidates based on:
- Architecture Thinking.
- Implementation Skills.
- Performance & Monitoring Awareness.
- Validation Strategy.
- Communication.
